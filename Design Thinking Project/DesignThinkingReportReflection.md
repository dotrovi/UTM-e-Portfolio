### Design Thinking Project

On the 25th of October 2023, our group was assigned with a task to create a prototype for
a design thinking project. After discussing what problems that exist in our society in this modern
era, we have concluded that smartphone usage has been rising recently, moreso to children that
could have an effect on their health. Prolonged use of smartphones has caused many to divert
their focus from important tasks to scrolling endlessly through social media such as TikTok. By
utilising the design thinking process, we have made a product that can help people to overcome
their addiction towards smartphone usage called "Escape The Phone".

Through numerous discussions and brainstorming sessions whether it was online or face-to-face, I gained a lot throughout the period of making our prototype and report for Design Thinking Project. I contributed both in writing the project and organising the contents of it to make sure it is aligned with the given rubric and format. Good communication and collaboration is important to ensure smooth progress of the project.

However, there are some things that did not go as planned. For starters, we did not share our own progress on the project each week. To prevent such thing to happen, having a spreadsheet where we can track our progress makes it better so that we know that each member is doing their tasks as planned. At least in the end, we managed to submit our complete report on time.

I look forward to presenting our prototype later on and show how impactful it is to society. <3
