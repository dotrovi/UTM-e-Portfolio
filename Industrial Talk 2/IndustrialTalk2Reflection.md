On 28th December 2023, there was an industrial talk by Ms. Qistina Batrisyia Binti Azman Shah, currently working in
Analytics Delivery, AI Operation at Credence, powered by Telekom Malaysia, and graduated from Universiti Teknologi 
Malaysia (UTM) with Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Engineering).

Credence was launched back in 6th July 2022 by Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM) which is a new cloud and digital services company 
focused to expand capabilities for enterprises in their digital transformation journey. Analytics is crucial in the tech industry 
and Credence is said to provide services needed for companies to not only benefit from analytics, but also A.I.

Ms. Qistina started her journey back in 2016 as an undergraduate in UTM, and did her industrial training as Social Media Data
Analyst at TMONE. The contents during her talk includes:
* What is analytics?
* Career in analytics
* Tech Used (database, visualization, ETL, programming languages)
* Workplace Culture in Credence
* Tips and Motivation

Workplace culture is one of the interesting parts during her talk, where she talks about:

- Open communication
> Other departments know other departments
>> Easily communicate with management personnel

- Continuous learning and development
> Opportunity to take a lot of certifications
>> Free e-learning
>>> Learn from experienced peers

- Empowerment and autonomy
> Given trust when able to do jobs efficiently

- Celebration of success
> When project delivered / good peformance, given bonus

I enjoyed the talk delivered by Ms. Qistina, however it would have been better if more speakers would be present during
the talk, especially in other departments other than analytics.

Based on the talk, our group have successfully made a report based on the contents of the talk.
