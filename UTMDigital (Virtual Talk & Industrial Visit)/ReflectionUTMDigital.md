Throughout the talk, I learned a lot of the functions of UTMDigital and how important they are in maintaining the digital services for UTM. For instance, Mr. Noor Haslan bin Sallehudin speaks about the ICT Security Management where they can detect user activity, whether it was their browsing history, amount of bandwidth used and blocking the usage of VPN among UTM Wi-Fi users.

On the 6th of December 2023, Dr Azurah A SAMAD brought our class, TIS SECP1513 Section 05 to visit UTMDigital.
We were introduced with the faculties of UTMDigital, including their open offices and UTM Digital Care.

Their open offices adapt google spaces offices that could fit 60 staff at once. They plan on to include more tables to accomodate about 20 to 25 more staff in this office. Workspaces, meeting rooms, discussion rooms and relaxation rooms are present in this open office which would contribute to a more productive environment for the staff.

Next was the UTM Digital Care offices. Their main role in UTM Digital services is to address ICT issues through e-mails. The issues received would go through multiple levels. At level 0, they are settled first through e-mail or a simple call. If the problem persists, it would go to the next level, level 1 that involves the technical team. The last level, level 2 would include straight to the providers, such as Telekom Malaysia.

The last part of the visit was the Data Center. We were told not to take any pictures at all when inside since the whole operations inside is secretive. Nonetheless, it was fascinating looking at how they handle data for the entirety of UTM inside a server room, monitored through a custom room named NOC, or network operations center. Data Center in UTM is considered tier three.

Overall, I was satisfied with the visit to UTMDigital. This experience is valuable and makes me more eager to finish my bachelor's degree with excellence and experience working in an environment similar to UTMDigital. I'd like to thank all the UTMDigital staff for their hospitality throughout the virtual talk and visit to UTMDigital.
