    <h1>PC ASSEMBLE (LAB)</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>During the PC Assemble session, I learned a lot regarding the interior of a PC and the necessary steps to both</p>
    <p>assemble and disassemble the PC from opening the front cover to removing the fan or cooler of the CPU.</p>
    <p>This session would have been more enjoyable if it also includes other components including GPUs and M.2 SSDs.</p>

    <p>Having a quiz at the end of the session is perfect to recap the session of PC assembly.</p>
    <p>I had fun throughout this activity!</p>
