    <p>On 1st November 2023, I had hands-on PC Maintenance class held at Makmal Invoasi (322-02) N28, Level 3A.</p>
    <p>During the said session, I learned a lot regarding the interior of a PC and the necessary steps to both</p>
    <p>assemble and disassemble the PC from opening the front cover to removing the fan or cooler of the CPU.</p>
    <p>This session would have been more enjoyable if it also includes other components including GPUs and M.2 SSDs.</p>

    <p>Having a quiz at the end of the session is perfect to recap the session of PC assembly.</p>
    <p>I've always enjoyed watching PC building videos online, so this experience was remarkable.</p>
    <p>All in all, I had fun throughout this activity!</p>
