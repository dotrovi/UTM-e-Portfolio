### PC ASSEMBLE (LAB)

On 1st November 2023, I had hands-on PC Maintenance class held at Makmal Invoasi (322-02) N28, Level 3A.
During the said session, I learned a lot regarding the interior of a PC and the necessary steps to both
assemble and disassemble the PC from opening the front cover to removing the fan or cooler of the CPU.
This session would have been more enjoyable if it also includes other components including GPUs and M.2 SSDs.

Having a quiz at the end of the session is perfect to recap the session of PC assembly.
I've always enjoyed watching PC building videos online, so this experience was remarkable.
However, as stated earlier, it would make the experience better if we were to conduct disassembly
and assembly on a more recent computer that includes modern compartments.
All in all, I had fun throughout this activity!
